# MVC v1.1.7

Use the `mvc` library to distill concurrent programs into pure and
single-threaded programs using the `Model`-`View`-`Controller` pattern.  The
`mvc` library makes pervasive purity practical.

`mvc` is guided by a single overarching design principle: application
architectures inspired by category theory scale in the large because they
reduce complexity and prevent proliferation of concepts.  Use `mvc` if you wish
to learn how to practically apply theory to tame large applications.

## Quick start

* Install the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/)
* `cabal install mvc`
* Read the documentation in the `MVC` module and the `MVC.Prelude` module

Optionally begin from this program skeleton:

    import MVC
    import qualified MVC.Prelude as MVC
    import qualified Pipes.Prelude as Pipes
   
    external :: Managed (View String, Controller String)
    external = do
        c1 <- MVC.stdinLines
        c2 <- MVC.tick 1
        return (MVC.stdoutLines, c1 <> fmap show c2)
   
    model :: Model () String String
    model = asPipe (Pipes.takeWhile (/= "quit"))
        
    main :: IO ()
    main = runMVC () model external

## Features

* *Determinism*: Perform property-based testing on your model (like
  `QuickCheck`)

* *Purity*: Move a substantial amount of your application logic into pure code

* *Semantics*: Equationally reason about your concurrency-free and pure core

* *Best practices*: Statically enforce decoupling

* *Concise API*: Only four types, and 8 primitive functions

* *Elegant semantics*: Use practical category theory

* *Extensive Documentation*: The haddocks contain extensive tips and idioms

## Development Status

The API is stable because I do not plan to generalize the API further. Any
future generalizations will be released as separate libraries.  The goal of this
library is to serve as a stepping stone towards understanding more sophisticated
and general application architectures, so I wish to preserve its simplicity for
pedagogical reasons.

Future development will focus on building an ecosystem of pre-built `View`s and
`Controller`s that applications can use, with a focus on tools useful for
user interfaces and games.

## How to contribute

* Build derived libraries

* Write `mvc` tutorials
